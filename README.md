# 🎨 Scribble Dash – Drawing Game App (Jetpack Compose)

**Scribble Dash** is a feature-rich Android drawing game built entirely with **Jetpack Compose**, designed as part of the **Mobile Dev Campus Main App Challenge** by [Philipp Lackner](https://plcoding.com). The goal: turn your screen into a creative playground — while applying serious software engineering best practices.

---

## 📱 Game Modes

- **🖌 One-Round Mode** – View a drawing for 3 seconds, then replicate it from memory.
- **⏱ Speed Mode** – Recreate as many drawings as possible in a limited time.
- **♾ Endless Mode** – Draw without limits and track your top accuracy scores.

---

## ✨ Latest Features

- **📊 Statistics Screen**
  - Track high scores in **Speed Mode** and **Endless Mode**
  - View percentage accuracy and total games played

- **🛍 Shop System**
  - Customize your canvas background (color or image)
  - Change pen colors
  - Unlock and apply styles using an in-app currency system

## ⚙️ Architecture & Tech

This app is more than just fun — it's **cleanly architected** and follows modern best practices:

- ✅ **100% Jetpack Compose** UI
- ✅ **Clean Architecture (Multi-layered)**
- ✅ **MVVM + Unidirectional Data Flow**
- ✅ **State Management** with `StateFlow` and `ViewModel`
- ✅ **Navigation-Compose** for routing
- ✅ **Dependency Injection** with manual setup (no 3rd-party DI libraries)
- ✅ Follows **SOLID**, **DRY**, and **KISS** principles

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- How to implement custom **canvas drawing logic**
- How to build **bitmap comparison algorithms** for accuracy scoring
- Using **Sequences and StateFlows** efficiently
- Modularizing a Compose project using **clean separation of concerns**
